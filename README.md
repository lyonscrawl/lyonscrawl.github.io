# üö® Forking this repo (please read!)

Many people have contacted me asking me if they can use this code for their own website, and the answer to that question is usually yes, with attribution.

I value keeping my site open source, but as you all know, plagiarism is bad. It's always disheartening whenever I find that someone has copied my website without giving me credit. I spent a non-trivial amount of effort building and designing this iteration of my website, and I am proud of it! All I ask of you all is to not claim this effort as your own.
